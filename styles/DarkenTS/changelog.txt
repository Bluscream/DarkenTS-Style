* Known problems:
 * Hyperlinks (except for links in chat and channel description), friend/foe name colours, name colours in 3DSoundWidget, position of user avatars and status icons, etc use default style
   * Those values are hard-coded and cannot be changed from my side. A style implementation by the TeamSpeak team is unprovided for in the foreseeable future (http://goo.gl/WTVSQA).
 * PreviewWidget has no style (style option needs to be implemented by the TeamSpeak team)
 * Spacing in channelinfo.tpl is off in channels with a Max Users setting of 0. Too obscure/rare to adjust.
 * Private channels are using register.png instead of channel_private.png. Nothing I can do from my side.
 * "Customize Toolbar" separator icon seems to be hard-coded and cannot be changed from my side.
 * "Customize Toolbar" QToolBar icons seem to be hard-coded and cannot be changed from my side.
 * "Expand QMenuBar" and "Expand QToolBar" (if Main Window width is too small to display full Menu and Tool Bar) icons seem to be hard-coded and cannot be changed from my side.
 * Overwolf icon is hard-coded and cannot be changed from my side.
 * Add-ons that use QOpenGLWidget are not supported by this theme and may be limited in functionality.
 * QMessageBox in Sound3DWidget seems non-customisable. Too rare to pursue.
 * Addon "Browse Online" feature is pulling information straight from the web and cannot be styled
* I have by the way no idea how software Versioning works. (Maybe I do now a little.)
* Shout-out to xPoke for his awesome Mumble design (https://github.com/xPoke/MetroMumble/releases/) which has been the inspiration for DarkenTS.
